## Quick Experiments For Join Sampling Using Comunica

To use this repository, clone and install the following [Comunica respository and branch](https://github.com/RubenEschauzier/comunica/tree/feature/http-cache-sampling).

In this repository, we have various configurations, stored in `engines/config-query-sparql/config` of Comunica. The config for default (no sampling) Comunica is called `config-file.json`, while the version that tracks intermediate results is called `config-file-track-results.json`. In the same way, for sampling we have `config-file-sampling.json` and `config-file-sampling-track-results.json`

Then use `yarn link` to link `@comunica/query-sparql-file` and `@comunica/statistic-link-traversal` to this repository. This should us to use our local development version of Comunica
